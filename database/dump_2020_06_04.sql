Technical details about the sedan remain unclear. With that being said, we know it will ride on GM\'s third-generation EV platform and feature Ultium batteries. General Motors has confirmed its EV platform will be capable of packing 200 kWh battery packs, providing range-topping vehicles with at least 400 miles (644 km) of range.',0,1,0,'2020-05-24 21:48:44','2020-05-30 22:49:21'),(28,'Cadillac','Elmiraj',35,189999.00,999.00,'White','convertible','new',2020,'automatic','gasoline','db28.jpg','The car is a 2-door, 4-seat full-size luxury coupe.

All perception of speed is perverted, such that the car will not feel fast until you have left the double digits well behind. At this point, it will occur to you that you do not seem to be spending much time at wide-open throttle. It seems like a heinous oversight on your part, but it is OK. This car is so powerful that trying to get to wide-open throttle just for the sake of it will cause you to drive erratically. You will always be at full throttle or full brake, never enjoying the in-between. Waiting for the appropriate time and place for full throttle makes it all the more rewarding, and everywhere else, the throttle\'s adjustability allows you to fine-tune exactly the amount you need for any given situation.','2020-04-18 23:30:15'),(7,1,33,'4','It gives me great pleasure to write that, because it wasn\'t the initial impression from our instrumented testing session. There, the 812 put up fantastic numbers but felt loose and a bit unrefined. On the figure eight, it wanted to be manhandled. Driving delicately just got you midcorner understeer. Coming in hot with a healthy portion of trail braking delivered extra bite from the front tires and rotated the rear slightly. Once the understeer was managed, you could aim for the exit and roll on the throttle, at which point it became all about managing power oversteer. The ultra-quick steering and easily adjusted throttle make it easy to do a little drift off the exit, and even with a slight rear weight bias and front-mid-engine placement, it\'s not snappy like a mid-engine car. If you\'re using CT Off mode rather than ESC Off, the computer will let you hang the rear end out, provided you\'ve got it under control, but just wood it, and the nanny will straighten you right out.','2020-04-18 23:30:15'),(8,14,41,'5','It\'s refreshingly devoid of driver-selectable modes. The choices that exist are basic. You can switch off the electronic stability control and traction control, and there\'s a stiffer Sport mode for the suspension. Even on the track, such is the poise and balance on offer that you won\'t feel inclined to mess around with any of those. There\'s a sport exhaust button for more sound, plus an auto blip button that rev-matches on downshifts if you\'re not able to roll onto the throttle yourself via fancy footwork. Other than that, it\'s just an unadorned steering wheel, three pedals and a gearstick.','2020-04-18 23:30:15'),(9,12,41,'5','When it comes to two-seat sports cars, few make an impression like the 2020 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT. Sleek yet aggressive, the AMG GT looks part fighter jet and part classic grand-touring car. The military hardware comes in the form of a turbocharged V8 fitted underneath GT\'s long hood. Mercedes offers it in three different states of tune, with 577 horsepower at its most potent. That won\'t necessarily raise a whole lot of eyebrows considering you can get more power from a Mustang or Camaro these days, but this engine has gobs of high-revving V8 personality. Plus, in handling, the GT is easily on par with any of today\'s top sports cars from Audi, Jaguar and Porsche.','2020-04-18 23:30:15'),(10,17,41,'5','A good sports car needs to look the part, and debatably, the 2020 Supra does. I\'m not completely in love with it, but it\'s attractive, and definitely distinct. There\'s some fourth-gen Supra styling inspiration sprinkled into the front end and the nose takes cues from Formula 1 racers. Personally, I find the rear three-quarter angle the best view: The curvy haunches and integrated spoiler hark back to the old Supra. As for the faux hood and door vents, I actually don\'t mind them, and take comfort in knowing that they likely will become functional should hotter Supra models launch down the line. The Supra garners its fair share of attention from people at stoplights and in parking lots. In one instance, it caused a guy walk out of work, hop in his Scion FR-S, and follow me into a parking lot to talk my ear off for 30 minutes on a hot, sunny, sticky day.
